I used tailwind to attempt to recreate the designs given for mobile, tablet, and desktop
Peer Reviewed By: Bronel Lazar
Peer Review: The site looks good, though in the prototype the desktop image with the blocks extends slightly past the home button on the navbar, and on this site it extends to the beginning of the popular button. The read more button is missing the red background on it, and there is a strange border in the mobile menu. The mobile menu could also use more spacing between buttons, and could be a bit larger.
